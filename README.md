# ENGR1-Arduino

This file was used in our ENGR 1L final project. It's an Arduino file, meant for our automated Piggy Bank! 
The circuit schematics are on TinkerCAD, feel free to email me if you'd like to take a peek. It essentially is a Light-Dependent Resistor and multi-jointed servo-motors.

- Placing a coin on the Piggy Bank's 'hand' would cover the resistor and reduce the amperage.
- This reduction would trigger the servos to activate "throwing" the coin into itself and storing it.
- * I could be wrong about the resistor usage, it could've been a light-sensor as well. It basically activates depending on the values of the sensor.
